# v1.4-Operation-IIP

Operation Investing In People (IIP) is a game changer in moving the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) model. DEI, in more recent years, has been gaining traction, especially in corporate companies with media coverage, social activism, and company annoucements. There are businesses who claim they follow the DEI motto, but follow through with silence and inaction. The website I created demonstrates forming allyship and holding accountable a client company - Commonfund - that I worked with. The website currently functions as a landing page with information, data, and a Call To Action (CTA) form.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML 

I have used imports, exports, functions, const values to complete the website in addition to numbering groups. Elements much like align, height, display, width were used when building the CSS out. I have taken photos from Google to complete the visuals of the landing page. When it comes to the React featues, I did not make them too complex. Users have the option of interacting with the questionnaire form task towards the bottom of the page and the button when you first get onto the page.  

## Optimizations

In the demo, users can scroll up and down the landing page as well as have a hovering option of the button and questionanire form. In future iterations, I would like to ensure the demo has full testing version where users can actually type their name, e-mail, and message. The same applies for the button except to be able to be dragged from the top of the page to the bottom. I would like to, with research and data, include in analytics and a stronger copy in future optimiziations. 

## Lessons Learned:

Design is just as complex as coding in my opinion. Both require tons of time to make each version better and the audacity to make changes to make the last version better. I learned that, in particular, DEI work does not always need to be innovative to the point of "investing the wheel." It just needs to match the needs of today's society. I am progressing with my React JS by incorpoating what I am learning in the form of projects.
